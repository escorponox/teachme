echo "The ping command is used to determine if a computer with a specified IP address is accessable. This command is part of the TCP/IP set of protocols. The ping command sends data packets (ICMP) to the supplied IP address. If the computer system at the other end is 'listening' (and is configured to repond to ping requests) it will answer back. The sending computer will be able to determine how long it took for the packet to reach the computer and recieve the response as well as how many hops it took to get there."
