# the command's description
echo "Much like the command line version of rm, git rm removes a file. With git rm, however, the file is removed from the working tree and the index. This effectively removes the file from both the file system directory as well as git's working tree. The file being removed must be identical to the file in the latest commit, if the file has any changes that haven't been commited the rm will fail. This behaviour can be overridden with the -f (force) flag."
